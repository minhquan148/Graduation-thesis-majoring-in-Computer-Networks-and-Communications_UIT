### 1.1 Overview
- With the rapid increase in the number of vehicles participating in traffic, the infrastructure and management agencies responsible for traffic order are unable to keep up with this growth. Consequently, traffic violation detection has become a highly attractive field, aiming to improve the effectiveness of monitoring and handling traffic violations.
- Given this opportunity, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) technologies have enhanced computers' ability to intelligently recognize, understand, and process images. Through training, ML models can identify objects and interpret images in an automated manner similar to how humans perceive and process them. In such systems, computer vision helps to identify and localize key image areas that need to be recognized, such as traffic lights, signals, stop lines, and vehicle license plates.
- The combination of Deep Learning and computer vision aims to detect traffic violations based on traffic signals. However, this research faces several challenges, including designing an appropriate Deep Learning model, the capability of object recognition, and optimizing performance and accuracy for practical applications.
- In summary, research into computer vision and Deep Learning models for building smart traffic systems capable of detecting traffic violations at traffic lights, especially at the Vietnam National University - Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM), significantly contributes to traffic safety and minimizes potential accidents.

### 1.2 Reasons for Choosing the Topic
- Not yet widely implemented at VNU-HCM, allowing for deployment and application at this location.
- Effectively addresses current issues: non-compliance with traffic laws often leads to accidents.
- Saves human resources, with the system capable of automatically monitoring and detecting violations.

### 1.3 Research Objectives
The main purpose of this study is to develop a "SYSTEM FOR TRAFFIC VIOLATION DETECTION AND INFORMATION QUERY APPLICATION BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING MODELS" to automate the process of issuing fines and maintaining traffic order. The system will utilize various Deep Learning models to process data collected from surveillance cameras, allowing for automatic handling.

  - Traffic Light Images: Initial data collection includes images of three types of traffic lights (go, stop, warning â€“ green, red, yellow).
  - License Plate Images: Initial data collection includes images of various license plates from different locations.
  - Data Labeling: The labeling process identifies license plates in each image, creating a labeled dataset for model training.
- **Building and Developing Deep Learning Models:**
  - Using deep learning models such as SSD MobileNet v2, Inceptionv3 to detect and classify traffic lights and violating vehicles.
  - Using the Hough Line Transform algorithm to detect stop lines at red lights.
